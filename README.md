## Assignment
> This project will ask you to combine some of the literary analysis skills that we have been working so far this semester with archival research. Taking inspiration from our study of Maus, you will be asked to delve into archival research relating to the topic of war, and then to bring that source to life through creative and analytical modes of composing. This project will require you to complete the following objectives:
> - To conduct archival research and to develop a project that enables you to engage critically and creatively with the primary source.  
> - To support your argument about the importance of  your primary source document with creative reproduction of  its content.  
> - To contextualize the archival source within an analytical framework that helps your reader better understand the historical importance of the source." 

-Dr. Solomon, Washington State University.
